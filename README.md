# 2 steps coaching website
I have been asked to design and create a website for a coaching company called '2stepscoaching'. In this repository you can see what steps I go trough for making websites, and you can read why I made certain decisions.

## Re-design
I have already created a website for this this company, but I'm deciding to re-design the website to make the website user friendly and easy to navigate trough. You can see the current online website at https://2stepscoaching.nl/
